# CNade

CNade is a game engine project made by Nadelio using C and OpenGL, along with several util libraries: GLAD, GLFW, CGLM, GLEW, and STB.\
This game engine was not made to have any practical purpose beyond learning the fundamentals of C and OpenGL as well as introducing myself into the world of graphical programming with languages like GLSL and OpenGL.
I got inspiration to make this game engine after watching a [series of videos](https://youtu.be/fSjc8vLMg8c?si=jnT86WA8S8iF-Yy5) by the Youtuber [JDH](https://www.youtube.com/@jdh).\
Hopefully this project comes out as a success as I am excited to build something with this game engine like what JDH has done with his.
I have a little bit of experience building games with a base framework of a game engine with my Java game WizardBattler, but it does not have the same graphical stress that this project does. I hope this project will throughly expand my knowledge of graphical programming and how to apply it to various applications such as games or tools with GUIs.
Finally,

Thank you for taking the time to read this and check out this project!\
Much love,
